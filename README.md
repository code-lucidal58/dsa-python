## Data Structures and Algorithms using Python
## Algorithms characteristics:
Algorithms have associated complexity:  
* space -> memory occupied  
* time -> time taken to complete task irrespective of input size  
* They have set of input and produces output

#Algorithms classification  
* series-> sequential fashion
* parallel -> break data set and work on each simultaneously
* exact -> provides exact value as output
* approximate -> output may or may not be exact e.g. face recognition
* deterministic -> steps know
* non-deterministic -> based on guesses

## Types of Algorithms
* searching -> search specific data in a larger data
* sorting -> sort a dataset
* computational -> take one data set and return another data set
* collection -> navigating through elements in a dataset

## Algorithms performance
Big-O notation: classifies performance as input size grows. O represents order of operation
